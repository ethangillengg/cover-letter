\newcommand{\whyMePersonalized}{More recently I have taken to “Git-ifying” my life as much as possible. I use it for my notes, resume (in LaTeX), projects, etc. I believe Git is an extremely powerful tool that has so many different use cases. I would be ecstatic to learn Git in even more depth at \companyName.

	During my coding journey, I have had the wonderful opportunity to work on multiple internships, each with their own unique technical challenges. At my current position, I have been working on developing solutions in Vue.js for clients. Due to this prior experience with Vue.js, I will be able to hit the ground running at \companyName’s frontend team.
